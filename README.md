# Snake
![Game screenshot](screen.png)
A basic little snake game.  Eat as many green squares as you can before dying.  Don't touch your tail or the edges of the screen!

Built with [termloop](https://github.com/JoelOtter/termloop), and originally made over a weekend as part of the [codelympics Go Game Jam](https://codelympics.io/projects/2).  This repository continues the work in the [original](https://github.com/jodizzle/snake).
